\subsection{Summary}
\begin{frame}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Problem of subgrid axial heterogeneity for planar synthesis methods was described
        \item Rod cusping was identified as most severe axial heterogeneity
        \item Three new methods developed to address this problem:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Polynomial decusping: Fast and simple to implement, limited accuracy
            \item Subplane collision probabilities: minimal runtime increases, good accuracy
            \item Subray MOC: complicated to implement efficiently, very good acccuracy
        \end{itemize}
        \item Give some more details, but this is the general idea
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{frame}[t]{Methods Improvements}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Polynomials: more rod materials
        \item Subplane collision probabilites: other solvers (2D r-z CP, 2D MOC pin cell solver, 3D MOC, etc.)
        \item Subray MOC: optimization, shielding, other stuff MPACT does already (Pn/parallelism), improvements to a couple approximations (constant radial shape for source calculations, radial current tallying on subplane mesh)
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

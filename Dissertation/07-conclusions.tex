\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallelism - radial decomp, threading
    \item Efficiency - Algorithms/data structures should be redesigned to expect subrays
    \item RTL - tally currents/surface fluxes on subsurfaces to improve the dhats/RTL
    \item Pn Scattering
    \item Shielding - Implemenation and research questions
    \item Axial TL? - Mike's results seem to say it's not that important but it seems like it should be (maybe for non-LWR)
    \item Better understanding/implementation of how long to track separate rays
    \item Nodal doesn't work at the moment
\end{itemize}

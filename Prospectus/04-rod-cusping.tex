This chapter will focus specifically on control rod cusping effects, which are the focus of this work.  First, a more thorough definition of the problem and motivation for solving it will be presented.  The next section will then present some of the solutions that have been used to minimize the cusping effects in the past, including a simplified decusping model implemented in MPACT itself.  The third section will then discuss some newer methods based on the sublpane CMFD scheme that have recently been implemented in MPACT.  Finally, a new ``sub-ray'' MOC method will be proposed to deal with the cause of the cusping effects on a more fundamental level.

\section{Background}

In Section \todo{section num}, some potential sources of errors for the 2D/1D scheme were introduced.  One of these was the error introduced by axial homogenization within a 2D MOC plane.  In some cases, this can be done without introducing significant errors.  For example, MPACT often homogenizes components outside the active fuel region, such as the end plugs and gaps at the end of the fuel rods.  However, when strong neutron absorbers, such as control rods, are homogenized axially in active fuel region, this has the effect of introducing absorption in regions where there should be none.  This effect is known as ``cusping,'' and is illustrated in Figure 

\begin{figure}

In some cases, this is easily handled by setting up an appropriate axial mesh which prevents the need for the homogenization, but this is not always a practical solution.  Throughout the course of an entire cycle of operation (usually about 18 months), several different control banks in the reactor may move to a variety of positions to maintain criticality in the core.  Control rods in a PWR typically have step sizes of approximately 1.5 cm, but a typical MOC plane in MPACT is about 8 cm thick in the active fuel region.  In order to prevent cusping effects for an entire cycle, the user may have to create a very detailed axial mesh to ensure that all the control rod positions used throughout the cycle align with the edge of an MOC plane.  Not only is this tedious for the user, but it also greatly increases the computational burden due to the increased number of MOC planes.  Figure \ref{f:p4cuspingEffects} shows the calculated k-eff as a function of control rod position.  The cusping effects in this figure are further complicated by a heterogeneous rod with AIC and B$_4$C poison regions and a stainless steal tip.  Thus, cusping effects occur not just at the control rod tip, but also at material interfaces throughout the rod.

\subsection{2D/1D Codes}\label{ss:2d1d-old-decusping-methods}

Several codes that have employed the 2D/1D method in recent years have also required rod decusping methods.  MPACT currently uses a simple polynomial correction to the volume fractions used to homogenize the control rod \cite{MC2015_VCS_Cycle_Depletion}.  To develop this method, a 3x3 assembly was set up with a control rod in the center assembly.  This problem was simulated with the rod tip at nine different positions in the plane.  These simulations were then repeated, but with the axial mesh refined so the rod tip aligned with a plane boundary.  The k-eff differences between the two sets of simulations were fitted with a sixth-order polynomial which is used in MPACT to reduce the volume fraction of the control rod by an appropriate amount to offset the cusping effects.  This process was repeated for different control rod materials such as AIC, B$_4$C, and Tungsten, since each material has unique cross-sections.  This method has the advantages of being simple to implement and requiring no increase in computational requirements.  However, the results obtained from this decusping method are tied to the control rod material and reactor model used to develop the corrections, limiting its usefulness to a small subset of reactors.

Another 2D/1D code is nTRACER, which is under active development by Seoul National University\todo{new citation}.  To address rod cusping effects in nTRACER, Jung and Joo developed a more general method than the polynomial correction method used by MPACT \cite{ICAPPcontrolRodDecuspingNTRACER}.  This method pre-generates correction factors at the start of a simulation, rather than relying on hard-coded corrections.  To do this, the assembly that will have a partially inserted control rod is identified, and a single-plane 3x3 assembly problem is set up using the partially-rodded assembly and its neighbors.  The radial and axial cusping effects are then determined separately.  First, the radial cusping effects are determined by performing 2D MOC calculations on the 3x3 sub-domain with the rod fully inserted and fully withdrawn.  This provides radial flux profiles in the rodded assembly for both rodded and unrodded regions, as well as current coupling coefficients for CMFD for the rodded and unrodded CMFD nodes.  Once this is done, the rod is simulated at positions of 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% withdrawn from the plane.  To reduce runtime, these calculations are done using only 3D sub-plane CMFD, using the heterogeneous rodded and unrodded cross-section for the appropriate sub-planes.  This generates axial flux profiles for the full MOC plane for each of the possible rod positions.  During the full-core 2D/1D calculation, these axial flux profiles are then used to generate improved homogenized cross-sections for the MOC calculation using equation.

\begin{equation}\label{e:nTRACERdecusping}
\overline{\Sigma_i} = \frac{\phi_{rad,i}^R \phi_{ax,i}^R \Sigma_i^R h^R + \phi_{rad,i}^U \phi_{ax,i}^U \Sigma_i^U h^U}{\phi_{rad,i}^R \phi_{ax,i}^R h^R + \phi_{rad,i}^U \phi_{ax,i}^U h^U}
\end{equation}

\section{New Decusping Techniques}
\todo{Better Title?  Not that much ``better''}

This section discusses two new decusping treatments added to MPACT.  These methods rely on the sub-plane scheme described in section \ref{ss:2d1d-3dcmfd}.  The first method only treats the axial cusping effects, while the second method extends the first by also treating the radial decusping effects.

\subsection{Sub-plane Decusping}

In section \ref{ss:2d1d-3dcmfd}, the sub-plane scheme was introduced as a means of coarsening the 2D/1D axial mesh to improve runtime while maintaining accuracy.  However, one negative consequence of using the sub-plane scheme is that it increases the likelihood of partially inserted rods being present since there are fewer, thicker MOC planes.  To address this, two modifications were made to the sub-plane scheme to minimize cusping effects.

The first modification that was made was to modify the cross-sections used for the sub-plane CMFD and axial SP$_3$ calculations.  In the most basic form of the sub-plane scheme, the same cross-sections and radial coupling coefficients are used for all sub-planes in each MOC plane.  To use sub-plane as a decusping method, the requirement for constant cross-sections was removed.  Thus, when equation \ref{e:CMFDhomogTerms} is applied, explicit rodded or unrodded cross-sections are used for the cross-section homogenization in each sub-plane, rather than a single homogenized cross-section being using in all sub-planes.  This allows the CMFD and axial solvers to capture the sharp flux gradients that occur around the edge of the control rods.

In order to improve the MOC calculations as well, the CMFD flux projection described in equation \ref{e:CMFDscaling} is extended to also include a cross-section projection for the partially rodded pin cells.  This is done using equation \ref{e:nTRACERdecusping} with $\phi_{rad,i}^R = \phi_{rad,i}^U$.  This allows the 2D MOC calculations to also capture some of the axial effects of the partially inserted rod.

\subsection{Auxiliary 1D Collision Probabilities}

While the sub-plane decusping method is better than none, it captures only the axial effects of the partially inserted rod.  To also capture the radial effects, an additional radial calculation is needed to obtain radial flux profiles for the rodded and un-rodded regions.  In MPACT, this is done using a 1D Collision Probabilities (CP) solver.

After the CMFD homogenization, but prior to the calculation itself, a 1D CP kernel is solved for the rodded and un-rodded regions to obtain a radial flux profile.  This calculation uses the MOC cross-sections in each radial zone, along with a buffer region that consists of the eight neighboring CMFD cells homogenized together.  These profiles are normalized so that the volume-average of each profile is exactly unity.  These profiles are then used with the sub-plane CMFD flux and material cross-sections to calculate improved homogenized cross-sections, as shown in equation \ref{e:CPMxs}.  Homogenizing the cross-sections in this way allows CMFD to capture both axial and radial effects of the partially inserted rod with negligible increase in computational expense.  This process is illustrated in figure \ref{f:CPdecusp}.

\begin{equation}\label{e:CPMxs}
\Sigma_{g,i}=\frac{1}{\phi_{g,i}V_i}\sum_{r=1}^{N_{rings}} \Sigma_{g,r} \phi_{CMFD,g,i} \phi_{CP,g,r} V_r
\end{equation}

  \caption[Collision Probabilities Decusping]{Illustration of 1D Collision Probabilities rod decusping method}\label{f:CPdecusp}
\end{figure}

After the CMFD calculation, the MOC cross-sections must be modified as with the sub-plane decusping.  This is done using by using equation \ref{e:nTRACERdecusping} directly, where the radial flux terms are the projected MOC fluxes and the axial flux terms are the results of the sub-plane CMFD calculation that used the CP-homogenized cross-sections.  The projection of the CMFD flux to the MOC mesh is unchanged from the standard sub-plane scheme.  The CMFD calculation flow when using 1D CP is shown in figure \ref{f:1dcpm-flowchart}

The first part of this chapter will discuss results of calculations with each of the decusping methods implemented in MPACT.  We will see which of them is best and how much room there is for improvement.  The second part of the chapter will discuss the results of some tests performed with a 1D MOC code.  These results will focus primarily on the effects that partially inserted rods have on the angular flux, rather than applying corrections to the cross-sections or scalar fluxes at the end of a calculation.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item A transport-based solution that resolves decusping directly with 
      MOC is desired
      \item To aid in developing this method, a 1D MOC code was written
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Able to visualize and analyze angular flux
        \item Simulations with mixed roddded/unrodded cross-sections
        \item Can perform fixed source (fission or total) and eigenvalue 
        calculations
      \end{itemize}
      \item Results provide insights into effects of rod cusping on angular flux
    \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1D model of VERA Problem 4
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Center row across all 3 assemblies (51 pin cells)
    \item center assembly has 4 partially rodded positions
    \item C5G7 cross-sections \cite{EELewisC5G72003,EELewisC5G7extended2005}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Eigenvalue calculation performed to generate fission and scattering 
  source 
  distributions
  \item MOC sweeps used this source for 0\%, 50\%, and 100\% rodded 
  cross-sections

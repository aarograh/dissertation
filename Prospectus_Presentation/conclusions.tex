\begin{frame}[t]{Conclusions}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rod cusping problem explained and demonstrated
        \item New decusping methods developed
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improved accuracy over previous methods
            \item Minimal runtime increases
            \item Still room for improvement
        \end{itemize}
        \item 1D MOC results showed effects of volume homogenization on angular flux
        \item Sub-ray MOC method development motivated by current decusping methods and 1D MOC results
    \end{itemize}
